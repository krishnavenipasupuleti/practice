India perhaps is amongst few countries of the world <br>
which is blessed with a rich historical past. <br>
Some glimpses of its glorious history, <br>
can be reminisced from the majestic and imposing monuments <br>
spread across the length and breadth of the country. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
One of these monuments, which also finds place in the UNESCO list of <br>
‘wonders of the world,’ is the Taj Mahal at Agra. <br>
This was built by Emperor Shah Jahan<br>
 in memory of his loving wife Mumtaz Mahal,<br>
 more then three hundred and fifty years ago.<br>
